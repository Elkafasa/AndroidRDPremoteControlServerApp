Extended description:
This app runs an RDP remote control server that can be discovered by devices on the same wifi this is meant for gaming using an rdp remote control client it needs no root access to run just install change accessibilty settings to allow remote control and then run this app also allows you to pick specific apps instead of giving full remote control there's touch control, controller, mouse, and keyboard support, although I need to note that this app is in development and in beta, I am also working on a dedicated ipados/ios client.
